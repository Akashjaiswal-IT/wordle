# wordle
clone of game - wordle

This project is a simple clone of the popular word puzzle game Wordle, built for practice and learning purposes. The goal was to recreate the core mechanics — guessing a five-letter word within limited attempts — while focusing on clean UI, logic handling, and user feedback.

Features:
Word validation and feedback (green/yellow/grey system)
Keyboard input and visual hints
Basic styling similar to the original Wordle
